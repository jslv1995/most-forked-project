# Highest Github Forks Count

## Overview
This project uses Python to analyze and sort Github's public repositories by highest fork count. Then the top 100 are displayed on a bar chart. 

## Libraries Used
- requests: API calls
- plotly: Visualizing results

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jslv1995/top-github-fork-count.git
    cd top-github-fork-count

2. Activate your virtual environment:
    source .venv/bin/activate

3. Install the required packages:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the script:
    python main.py

## Future Enhancements
- Machine Learning: Analyze the results to see how much information is repeated in these top 100 results.
